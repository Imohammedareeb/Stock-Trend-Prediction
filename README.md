# 📈 Stock Trend Prediction using Python & Power BI
The Stock Trend Prediction project aims to analyze and forecast stock trends for selected companies using historical data, Python-based analysis, and interactive dashboards in Power BI. This project is designed to support better investment decision-making by combining machine learning techniques with data visualization.

🔍 Overview
This project leverages Python libraries for data preprocessing, analysis, and machine learning to predict stock price movement trends. Power BI is used to create an intuitive, interactive dashboard that visualizes stock performance, trends, and key insights. It includes analysis for companies like Tesla, TCS, Netflix, Power Grid, and Zomato.

🧠 Features
1. 🔢 Data Preprocessing & Cleaning: Cleaned and structured raw stock market data for analysis.
2. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations to understand price patterns and stock behavior.
3. 🔍 Machine Learning Models: Used models like Linear Regression, ARIMA, and LSTM for trend prediction.
4. 📉 Forecast Visualization: Power BI dashboard to display historical data and future trends.
5. 📂 Multi-Company Support: Analyzed 5 companies: tesla.csv, tcs.csv, netflix.csv, powergrid.csv, and zomato.csv.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
1. Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, keras
2. Power BI: Interactive visualization and forecast dashboard
3. Jupyter Notebook: For data analysis and model training
4. Streamlit (Optional): For deploying a web-based prediction app

📌 Project Workflow
1. Load and preprocess historical stock data.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to find trends and patterns.
3. Train machine learning models to predict future stock trends.
4. Visualize insights and forecasts using Power BI.
5. (Optional) Deploy a user-friendly app with Streamlit for real-time prediction.
